The application is built using React, Redux Toolkit, and other auxiliary
libraries, which you can find in the package.json file. The server is
json-server.

To start working with the application, download the repository locally to your
computer, and then open it using an application like VSCode.

---

Open the terminal and start the application with the command `npm start`.

Open a second terminal in parallel and start the server using the command
`json-server --watch db.json --port 3001`.

---

Now you can add, delete, edit, and track deadlines for your tasks using the
calendar!
